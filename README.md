The RMCQ_Control_ModuleA1-7 is used for the Eastern end main yard in and out to both main lines. This file is the old file that was in use. With the Redesign in Jun 2018 a new repository will be created.
To use the program you will need to download/install two libraries. Use the in built Arduino Servo library and the RMCQControl Library.
To install the RMCQControl library, download the RMCQControl.zip file and extract its contents to your Arduino libraries folder. To test that you have you set it up correctly, download RMCQ_Control_ModuleA1-7.ino to your local machine and open in the Arduino IDE and try to complie the program. If it complies with any errors, you have done it correctly.
